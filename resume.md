#### _RISC-V Emulator and Assembler, Oct. 2018 - present._
* Developing an emulator for the RISC-V open ISA in C. Currently working on implementing the RV64G instruction set, while developing an assembler in C++ targeting the same architecture.

#### _Multiple-Precision Fractal Generator, Dec. 2017_
* Developed a multithreaded portable application for generating and rendering fractals, with support for arbitrary floating-point precision and color image output. Utilized concurrency and hardware-accelerated floating point libraries to improve runtime over sequential algorithms, while providing arbitrary accuracy.
