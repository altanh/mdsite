Hi! My name is Altan Haan, and I'm currently a junior at the University of Washington pursuing a BS. in Computer Science and Mathematics. On this site you'll find my résumé, current/past projects, and other miscellaneous items like my blog (where I post occasionally). 

## About This Site
This site is powered by [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a lightweight Python web framework. The pages here are really just CommonMark files (i.e. Markdown with some more features), although inline HTML is used to make things look nicer where appropriate. For the grid layout, I'm using [Simple Grid](https://simplegrid.io/) since it's simple and gets the job done.
